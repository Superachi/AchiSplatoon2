Thanks for trying out my mod! Note: this mod is very glitchy in multiplayer and thus not recommended for that.

SFX and Splatoon as a franchise belong to Nintendo!

This mod adds gear based on the Splatoon games. Head out into the world with main, sub and special weapons of your choice!
You can craft your first items by using Iron Bars and Gel.
Defeat bosses to earn Sheldon Licenses, which can be converted at an anvil to powerful weapons.
Can you defeat the Moon Lord using only Splatoon-themed weaponry?

> Main weapons
These are weapons most similar to what you're used to in Terraria.
By default, left-click fires them. Some weapons require you to charge them, by holding down the button, before firing.
Right-click will consume the first sub weapon equipped in your ammo slot.
Some main weapons provide a bonus to sub weapons this way!

> Sub weapons
Mostly bombs, though some sub weapons are different.
They can be used from your hotbar directly, or used via right-click with a main weapon.

> Special weapons
Special weapons are a lot stronger than main or sub weapons, but are limited in use.
By attacking enemies (and through other means), you can fill
your special gauge.
When full, your character starts glowing, showing that your special weapon is ready for use!

> Color Chip palettes
Like in Splatoon 3's Side Order DLC, you can equip a palette accessory to boost your stats.
The palette is powered by color chips held in your inventory (this includes the Piggy Bank, Void Bag, etc.)
Empty color chips can be crafted using glass and sand, and can be combined with dyes to gain an effect.
A palette only works with up to a certain number of carried color chips.
