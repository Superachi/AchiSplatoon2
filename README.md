## Readme
Hello! This is the repository for my first Terraria mod, which adds a bunch of Splatoon related items.
If you'd like, you can create a fork and build upon it further/mess around with things.
Unfortunately, as its my first mod, I didn't know netcode until later on into the project, but at that point the technical debt wasn't worth dealing with IMO.
Also, this mod has been developed alone, so I didn't have others to review the code style/structure, and I didn't look at the codebase for other mods.
Thus, some features may be implemented differently than what you're used to in other mods.
If you have questions, you can reach me on Discord: @achi_
